## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This time, I tried to build a project using CSS Grid. Normally, I only use Flexbox, so it was cool to make it in a different way, which I found to be  much easier than just using Flexbox or float.
